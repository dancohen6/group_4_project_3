## <a name="descriptionlink"></a>Description
For Project 3, Group 4 decided to build a game that resembles the one and only Candy Crush. In our version of the candy-matching puzzle game, players will swipe and swap their way through hundreds (in the futre) of levels in order to rack up the highest scores and compete with their friends and other players.

Ania Kub√≥w's source code was used in order to get us started. This code provided us with a basic understanding of building a match-3 puzzle game.

## <a name="usagelink"></a>Usage 
To play the game, users move the colorful candy pieces around in order to match at least three candies of the same color in a row or column. As moves are made successfully, the pieces will vanish and the user's score will increase.

In addition to game play, users have the option to create an account and log in to save and access high scores. There is also a comment section where users can post tips and tricks to help other players succeed.

If the player would like to advance to Level 2, they have the option to pay for additional access.
